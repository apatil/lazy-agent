Implements two types of agent-based 'cells' for Clojure: lazy agents and oblivious agents. These complement the auto-agents available in Clojure Contrib. Both allow for concurrent cell updates with respectably efficient scheduling and avoid unnecessarily repeating cell updates.

When a lazy agent's ancestor changes, its value changes to {:needs-update true} but it does not compute its new value until it receives a message instructing it to do so. To send the update message to a group of agents, do (update a b c d e). To send the update message and wait for the values, do (evaluate a b c d e).

Oblivious agents are even lazier than lazy agents. When an oblivious agent's ancestor changes, it will not do anything. It needs to receive a 'force-need-update' message to change state to {:needs-update true}, but then it starts watching its parents for changes like a lazy agent until it computes.
